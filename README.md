# notes9

This shell script will install Lotus Notes 9 Client on Ubuntu 16.10.
Note: At this point in time, there are no error checking, so if the script fails at any point you may need to just run the commands one by one from the script to determine where it errors out and resolve before continuing on to the next command.
